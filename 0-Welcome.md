## II. Stack or Queue _(Stack)_
* Introduction:  <br>
    A stack is a linear data structure that follows an specific order
    in which the operations are performed called LIFO(last-in-first-out).
* Efficiency of common operations<br>
    O(1)
* Example:<br>
    In a restaurant they piled the dirty dishes on the side of the sink.
    The plate that is put last is the first one to be washed while the first plaste
    on the pile ends up being the last one to be washed.
* Problem to Solve: <br>
    Reverse a word using stacks
## III. Set or Linked List _(Set)_
* Introduction:<br>
   A set is a data structure that stores unique elements of the same type in a sorted way.
   The most appealing feature about a set is that it cannot contain duplicate items/
* Efficiency of common operations <br>
    O(n)
* Example <br>
   Adding duplicate songs in a playlist
    
* Problem to Solve <br>
  uniting two hashsets
## IV. Tree
* Introduction<br>
    A tree is used to represent data in a hierarchical format.
    Every node in a tree has 2 components (data, reference). The 
    top of the tree is called the Root node and the two products under it are called "left subtree" and "right subtree".
* Efficiency of common operations<br>
    O(n)
    
* Example <br>
    Get the height of a binary three
* Problem to Solve
    Print the left side of a three.
